# Data Storage Types

At current stage of Joker, there isn't any physical data types.
All the data that is stored and utilised into the system is stored in the system memory at runtime and is used by employing various types of STL data structures.
Later down the road, this data will be then transferred to physical files and thereby destressing the system memory.
And finally the system is expected to attach a proprietry DBMS that should improve the performance and logical sense of the Joker's architecture.
