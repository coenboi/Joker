# Data Structures

Currently Joker uses various types of STL data structures as its fundamental data containers.
Documentation for them is already available over the internet so rewriting their detail is omitted here.
Furthermore, explanation on how they are implemented into Joker is purposefuly left as an exercise to the interested reader.
*Read the code and figure it out and improve your coding literacy.*
Once Joker detaches itself from the dependency of STL and incorporates its own STL library, this documentation will be updated accordingly,
with all the explanation on their usage, performance boost, etc.
