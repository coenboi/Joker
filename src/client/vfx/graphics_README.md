# Graphics

During the first week of writing the Joker, I felt an unexplainable urge to make the interface a bit more presentable.
And since I was refreshing my C++ concepts again I just writing graphics file a go just for experimentation purposes.
As it can be already seen, it currently contains nothing than just a bunch of print statements that do
nothing much except slowing down the system (excessing usage of **std::endl**).
This graphics API system is almost better than nothing but down the road, this should be the file to watch out for.
Once the internal mechanics of Joker has completed its intial course of development, this Graphic API will start implementing the data in more digestable form.
Plans are just plans and currently the plan is to include:
- ASCII animations
- A simple version of network viewer.
- A basic tabulated data generator
- Some much better looking menu and other interfaces.
- etc.
