# Client

*The face of Joker.*


Client is not any entity that can explained in a few set of words. It is one the primary component of Joker containing various sub-systems inside of it deserving their own description.
In a summary, Client side is the face of Joker that contains everything that is needed to provide comfortable visual experience to the user. It doesn't computes anything on its own (99% of the time) and just provides visual representation of all the calculations, data management, etc that is done by Server side.

To understand more about the Client side of Joker. It is recommended for the user to go through the documentation of all the sub-systems in it:
- [Automated Robots](src/client/sys/src/bots/robot_readme.md)
- [Basic VFX]()
- [Credentials Handler]()
- [Data Visualizer]()
- [Network Viewer]()
- [Object Framework Implementation]()
- [Session Manager Port]()
- [User Interface]()
