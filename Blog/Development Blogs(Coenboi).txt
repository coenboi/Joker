Consider this example. Microsoft Windows is a software that works as a middleman between the user and system hardware.
To communicate with the Hardware, Window uses the drivers supplied by the hardware manufacturers.
Using the drivers, Windows creates applications and API (or, Ports), that can be used by the developer or user to create or use hardware as demand.
The problem here is about the access to the APIs and system settings. Although usage of drivers and API curbs the uncontrolled access to the hardware, but still it isn't full proof method.
In this method, there isn't any control to what degree a User and access the Settings and APIs.
This access may or may not be in the favor of system owner. One could exploit the available APIs to create malicious applications that might not be in the best interest of the owner.
To control this, Windows introduced a requirement of creating at least one ADMINISTRATOR in the system.
The ADMINISTRATOR account is provided with a vast access of APIs and Settings that could configure the system. But not every settings.
The critical configuration settings are generally hidden from the ADMINISTRATOR and are provided during only during diagnostics or security runs.
This secures the system from previous security loopholes and prevents ADMINISTRATOR from doing any unwanted changes.
The ADMINISTRATOR can configure the system to their needs and could also create an environment for others (USERS/GUESTS)
If every USER, on the other hand, in the SYSTEM had access to all the settings in the system. It would have created a deadlock of conflicting requests that would crash the system.
It would require a consensus system to mitigate the conflict but the overhead of a consensus has a exponential curve in proportion to users. And thus, would be a very computationally expensive in big distributed systems.
The ADMINISTRATOR provides the required governance in the system and USERS are only given the access to settings that they need. This reduces the chances of request collision.
The ADMINISTRATOR can CREATE or DELETE USERS and other ADMINISTRATORS from the system. These users follow a top down hierarchy.
If a User faces some issue in operating the system or requires some extra access to the settings, he or she is shown the familiar message 'Please contact your local system Administrator.'
The ADMINISTRATOR, using the array of tools provided to him could solve a great deal of lower-tier access control problems.
This keeps the system more operable and robust in varying circumstances.
NOTE: There are many critical functions in Windows that are beyond the access scope of any user (including ADMINISTRATOR). These functions are often stored in ROM and thus can't be edited.
For eg; Bootstrap Program Location, Windows Installation starting index, registry files and other encrypted sensitive information. etc.
They are usually Kernel functions and generally immutable values that are required for normal system operation.

Learning from this, Bi operates on the same principle.
In Bi, the operable hardware is Stand, Cycle, Lock and Database Server.
Having a direct access to any of these system is a massive security issue. Thus Bi comes in between.
Bi will provide library functions that themselves provide necessary API to access these hardware in a controlled manner.
Basically ports to operate these hardware.
The real-life entities in the system (Joker, Moderator, User, The Network, Cycle, Stand, Locks and Database) will have access to these APIs.
